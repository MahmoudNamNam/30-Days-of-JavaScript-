# LeetCode Solutions by Mahmoud Namnam

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/MahmoudNamNam/). I have been actively solving problems to improve my problem-solving skills and enhance my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, and software development.

## Problem Solving Approach

I aim to solve problems in an optimal and efficient way, with a focus on:
- **Understanding the Problem**: I carefully read and break down each problem, identifying edge cases and constraints.
- **Algorithm Design**: I focus on writing clean, efficient code, choosing the right data structure and algorithm based on the problem type (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking).
- **Optimizing Performance**: I work on improving both time and space complexity, striving to get the best possible solution.

## Key Topics

Iâ€™ve worked on a broad range of problems covering the following topics:

- **Arrays & Strings**: Techniques for manipulating and analyzing arrays and strings.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations and common operations with singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems with overlapping subproblems, memoization, and tabulation.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems where a local optimum can lead to a global solution.
- **Graphs**: Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms, etc.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal.
- **Backtracking**: Solving problems through recursive exploration of potential solutions.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms and efficient searching techniques.
- **Mathematical Problems**: Includes problems involving number theory and combinatorics.
- **Design Patterns & System Design**: I have also been working on implementing common design patterns and building scalable systems.
  
## LeetCode Statistics

I have solved over **350 problems** on LeetCode across a wide range of difficulty levels, from Easy to Hard.
