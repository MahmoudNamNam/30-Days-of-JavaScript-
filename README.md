# Memoize

[Link to the problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/memoize/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript)

## Problem Description

Write a function `memoize` that takes a function as input and returns a memoized version of that function. A memoized function caches its results based on the arguments passed to it, so that if the function is called again with the same arguments, it returns the cached result instead of recalculating it.

The `memoize` function should adhere to the following specifications:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Function} func - The input function to be memoized.
 * @returns {Function} - The memoized function.
 */
function memoize(fn) {
   const cache = new Map();
    return function(...args) {
        const key = JSON.stringify(args);
        if(cache.has(key)){
            return cache.get(key)
        }else{
            const result = fn(...args)
            cache.set(key, result)
            return result
        }
    }
}
````
Let's break down the code and explain each part:

1. **`const cache = new Map();`**: 
   - `Map` is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to store key-value pairs where both the keys and the values can be any type of data.
   - In this case, it is used to store the results of function calls. The keys are generated by stringifying the arguments passed to the function, and the values are the results of the function calls.

2. **`return function(...args) { ... }`**:
   - This is an example of a closure in JavaScript. It defines and returns an anonymous function that has access to the `cache` variable due to closure.

3. **`const key = JSON.stringify(args);`**:
   - `JSON.stringify` is a method in JavaScript that converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string.
   - Here, it's used to convert the `args` (arguments passed to the function) into a string. This string will be used as the key in the `Map` to uniquely identify each set of arguments.

4. **`if(cache.has(key)) { return cache.get(key); }`**:
   - Checks if the cache already has a value associated with the generated key.
   - If the key is found in the `Map` (indicating that the function has been called with the same arguments before), it returns the cached result.

5. **`const result = fn(...args); cache.set(key, result); return result;`**:
   - If the key is not found in the cache, it means the function hasn't been called with these arguments before.
   - It then calls the original function (`fn`) with the provided arguments (`...args`) and stores the result in the `cache` with the corresponding key.
   - Finally, it returns the result.

In summary, this code defines a higher-order function `memoize` that takes another function (`fn`) as an argument and returns a memoized version of that function. The memoized function caches the results of previous calls based on the arguments passed to it, avoiding redundant calculations for the same inputs.
