solution #1
For n > 1, Fn should return Fn-1 + Fn-2.
Time complexity : 2 ^n

'''
Solution #2
we are computing the already computed values of fib. Since there are overlapping subproblems, we can create and store the fib values in an array.
    Complexity
    Time complexity: O(n) (Linear complexity)
    Space complexity: O(n) since we store the fib values in array.

Solution #3; O(1) solution using Math
When we take any two successive (one after the other) Fibonacci Numbers, their ratio is very close to the Golden Ratio "Ï†" which is approximately 1.618034...
