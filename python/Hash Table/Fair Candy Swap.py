class Solution(object):
    def fairCandySwap(self, aliceSizes, bobSizes):
        """
        Finds a fair candy swap between Alice and Bob.

        Args:
        aliceSizes (List[int]): A list of integers representing the sizes of candy bars owned by Alice.
        bobSizes (List[int]): A list of integers representing the sizes of candy bars owned by Bob.

        Returns:
        List[int]: A list containing two integers representing the sizes of candy bars to be swapped
                   between Alice and Bob to achieve a fair distribution. If no fair swap is possible,
                   returns an empty list.

        Example:
        >>> solution = Solution()
        >>> solution.fairCandySwap([1, 1], [2, 2])
        [1, 2]
        >>> solution.fairCandySwap([1, 2], [2, 3])
        [1, 2]
        >>> solution.fairCandySwap([2], [1, 3])
        [2, 3]
        >>> solution.fairCandySwap([1, 2, 5], [2, 4])
        [5, 4]
        >>> solution.fairCandySwap([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
